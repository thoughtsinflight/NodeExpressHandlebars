# Node Express Handlebars
Node Express Handlebars is an app that takes a burger from a user put it into a database assign it an id and devour trait that is a boolean with the value of false. It then take that info from the database and displays it to the DOM with a button called Devour. When that button is click it changes the devour trait of that burger to true and move its position in the DOM to a list that marks it devoured.
## Motivation
The genesis of this app was the need to learn and exercise what I've learned about node modules, express mod and mysql databases.
## What I Learned
Deploying to heroku is still an issue for me but I learned more about how to set it up and with a database. Mysql and node module mysql was the focus of this homework and I feel comfident in my ability to use both.
